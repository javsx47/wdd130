        <p>The website will be focused on 3 pages, the home site, the shoelace sizing guide, and the contact us page

          pretty straight forward with a chart and a video reference and lastly the contact us page will have some contact details of our company
          and a frequently asked questions table.

        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          I'm gonna keep the colors simple because the main objective of the website is highlight the colors of the shoelaces so I will
          use black, white, and maybe a light tone of grey.
