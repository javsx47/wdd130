        <p>
          The audience is gonna be focused on young and fashionable people that like to change style and notice little things
          just like shoe laces, we will specialize in pairing with top Nike shoe models and some other notorious brands. We will
          focuse on answering questions such as how much will it cost? how much is the shipping cost? Can I retrurn my item? Warranty?

        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          I'm gonna keep the colors simple because the main objective of the website is highlight the colors of the shoelaces so I will
          use black, white, and maybe a light tone of grey.
